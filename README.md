## Structure

The project is divided into two main directories:
- **`Frontend/`**: React application with TypeScript for the user interface.
- **`Backend/`**: Node.js API server with Express and TypeScript for handling backend logic.

## Setup

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Install Dependencies

Navigate to both the `Frontend` and `Backend` directories and install the required dependencies:

```bash
# Frontend
cd Frontend
npm install

# Backend
cd Backend
npm install









2. Set Up Environment Variables
Copy the .env.example file to .env in both the Frontend and Backend directories.

Update the environment variables in the .env files as needed.

Example for Backend/.env:

plaintext
Copy
PORT=5000
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
Example for Frontend/.env:

plaintext
Copy
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
3. Run the Application
Start the backend server:

bash
Copy
cd Backend
npm start
Start the frontend development server:

bash
Copy
cd Frontend
npm start
The backend will run on http://localhost:5000.

The frontend will run on http://localhost:3000.
